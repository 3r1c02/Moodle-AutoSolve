> [!CAUTION]
> This extension is deprecated and does not work with the newest version the H5P Moodle integration.  
> I am done with all of the courses and I won't update this repository.

> [!NOTE]  
> According to H5P they want to fix the client side evaluation of the tasks in a future version
>
> "The user's answer is evaluated client side. This means that the correct answer also exists client side and it is easy for users familiar to web development to cheat on tasks in H5P. The evaluation of answers will be moved server side in future versions to avoid this." [Source](https://h5p.org/documentation/installation/security)
